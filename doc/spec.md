# Basic Binary Lisp Specification

## primary use case

Serialize complex C++ data structures including binary blobs.  Embeddable scripting as a secondary use case.

## goals

- binary data as a first-class citizen
- C++ compatible struct layout
- small implementation (single header or small lib)
- call from C, call to C
- strong performance
- simple tracing GC
- usable by LLM agents with minimum context engineering

## non-goals

- multithreading
- infix math (use prefix: `(+ a b)` — avoids ambiguity with hyphenated identifiers like `my-var`)
- strong typing in function args
- macros
- deterministic destruction (use explicit `close` for resources)

## types

### value types (copied on assignment)

`int` `float` `bool` `null` `struct`

Script values use two numeric types: `int` (64-bit signed integer) and `float` (64-bit IEEE double).  Narrow C types (`int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`, `float32`) exist only inside struct fields and typed vector elements — they are not script-level types.

`struct` instances are value types with C++-compatible binary layout.  Structs are POD — fields are numeric types, `bool`, and other structs only (no strings, containers, or functions in struct fields).  Structs are defined from C++ via `StructBuilder`, not from scripts.

### GC-managed types

- `string` — UTF-8 text, interned
- `binary` — raw byte buffer
- `fn` — function / closure
- `vector` — contiguous typed storage for value types and structs
- `table` — heterogeneous key-value container (string and integer keys)
- `userdata` — opaque `void*` with registered type descriptor, methods, and optional destructor

All GC-managed types are shared on assignment (same object, not a copy).

## syntax

### basics

S-expressions.  First element is the operator or function.  Comments are `//`.

```bbl
(print "hello")       // function call
(def x 10)            // define a new binding
(set x 20)            // rebind existing variable
(+ x 1)              // prefix math
```

### `def` and `set`

`def` creates a new binding in the current scope.  `set` rebinds an existing binding or writes to a place expression.

```bbl
(def x 10)            // new binding
(set x 20)            // rebind — x must already exist
(def x 30)            // shadows — new binding in current scope
(set y 5)             // error: y not defined
```

`set` walks the scope chain (local → captured → root).  If the name exists, it rebinds.  If not found, runtime error.  This prevents typo-based silent variable creation.

### lexer rules for literals

Symbols never start with a digit.  All numeric and binary literals start with a digit.  The lexer dispatches on the first characters:

| prefix | meaning | example |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `0b` | binary blob | `0b4096:...` |
| digit + `.` | float | `3.14` |
| digit | int | `42` |
| `"` | string | `"hello"` |

Symbols start with a letter, `_`, or `-` (after first char, digits are allowed too).

No integer suffixes.  There is one integer type (`int`, 64-bit signed).  No hex literals — add a `hex` stdlib function if needed later.

### binary data

Binary blob literal: `0b<size>:<raw bytes>`.  Size is a decimal byte count.  The lexer reads the size, reads `:`, then consumes exactly that many raw bytes (no escaping, no interpretation).  There is no terminator — the size tells the lexer where the blob ends.

The lexer reads all bytes immediately into memory.  No lazy loading.

```bbl
(def blob 0b4096:<4096 raw bytes>)
(def texture 0b65536:<65536 bytes of png data>)
```

### structs

See [structs.md](structs.md) for details.

Structs are registered from C++ via `StructBuilder`.  There is no script-level `struct` keyword.  Scripts use struct types as constructors and access fields via `.`:

```bbl
(def v (vertex 1.0 2.0 3.0))
(print v.x)
```

Structs are **value types** with C++ compatible binary layout.  POD only — no strings, containers, or functions in struct fields.  This guarantees `memcpy` copy semantics and zero-copy `getVector<T>()` from C++.

Structs compose:

```bbl
(def tri (triangle (vertex 0 1 0) (vertex 1 0 0) (vertex -1 0 0)))
```

### vectors

Contiguous typed storage for value types and structs.

```bbl
(def verts (vector vertex (vertex 0 1 0)))
(verts.push (vertex 1 0 0))
(verts.push (vertex -1 0 0))
```

### tables

Heterogeneous key-value container.  Replaces both ordered lists and hash maps.  Keys are strings or integers.  Values can be any type.

Constructed with alternating key-value pairs (string-keyed) or sequential values (integer-indexed):

```bbl
// string-keyed (like a map)
(def player (table "name" "hero" "hp" 100 "alive" true))

// integer-indexed (like a list)
(def items (table 1 "sword" 2 "shield" 3 "potion"))
```

Access via `.` for string keys:

```bbl
(print player.name)     // "hero"
(set player.hp 80)
```

Dynamic key access via `get` and `set` methods:

```bbl
(def key "hp")
(print (player.get key))   // 80
(player.set key 60)
```

Integer-indexed access via `at` (0-based positional):

```bbl
(print (items.at 0))       // "sword"
```

### functions

Functions return the value of their last evaluated expression.  There is no explicit `return` keyword.

```bbl
(def greet (fn (name)
    (print "hello " name "\n")
))
(greet "world")

(def double (fn (x) (* x 2)))   // returns (* x 2)
```

### closures

A `fn` expression captures free variables from the enclosing scope at the time it is evaluated.

- **Value types** are copied.  The closure gets its own snapshot.
- **GC-managed types** (string, binary, fn, containers, userdata) are shared — the closure holds a reference to the same object.  Mutations to a captured container are visible through the closure.
- **Rebinding** the outer variable after capture does not affect the closure — it holds the value that existed at capture time.

```bbl
// value capture
(def x 10)
(def f (fn () x))
(set x 99)
(f)                  // 10 (captured the old x)

// higher-order function
(def make-adder (fn (n) (fn (x) (+ x n))))
(def add5 (make-adder 5))
(add5 3)             // 8

// shared container
(def log (table))
(def record (fn (v) (log.push v)))
(record 1)
(record 2)
(print log.length)   // 2 (closure and outer scope share log)
```

### operators

**Arithmetic**: `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` — prefix.  `int + int = int`, `float + float = float`, `int + float = float`.  Three promotion rules.

`+` is variadic for strings — multiple string arguments are concatenated left-to-right: `(+ "hello" " " "world")` → `"hello world"`.  `+` on incompatible types (e.g. `int + string`) is a runtime error.

**Comparison**: `==` `!=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` — produce `bool`.  Numeric comparison promotes.  String `==`/`!=` use interned pointer equality (O(1)).  Ordering operators on strings are a type error.

**Logical**: `and` `or` `not`
- `and` and `or` are **short-circuit special forms** — the second operand is not evaluated if the first determines the result.
- `not` is a regular function (prefix): `(not (== x 0))`.
- All three operate on `bool` values only.  Passing a non-bool is a type error.

**Bitwise**: deferred to backlog.

### truthiness

Conditions in `if`, `loop`, and `and`/`or` must evaluate to `bool`.  Non-bool values in conditions are a type error.  There is no implicit truthiness — `0`, `null`, and `""` are not falsy; they are simply not bool.

### special forms

| form | purpose |
|------|--------|
| `def` | create a new binding in current scope |
| `set` | rebind existing variable or write to place expression |
| `loop` | while-loop |
| `if` | conditional branching |
| `and` | short-circuit logical AND |
| `or` | short-circuit logical OR |
| `fn` | function definition (creates new scope, captures free variables) |
| `exec` | run another file |

### control flow

`loop` and `if` are special forms — their bodies run in the enclosing scope.

```bbl
(def i 0)
(loop (< i 10)
    (print i "\n")
    (set i (+ i 1))   // modifies enclosing scope's i
)
```

`if` takes a condition, a then-body, and an optional else-body:

```bbl
(if (== x 0)
    (print "zero")
    (print "nonzero")
)
```

`if` is a statement — it does not return a value.  To compute a value conditionally, use a function or assign in both branches:

```bbl
(def label "other")
(if (== choice 0) (set label "zero"))
(if (== choice 1) (set label "one"))
```

`loop` is a statement — it does not return a value.

### iteration

Use `loop` with `at` and `length`:

```bbl
(def i 0)
(loop (< i (verts.length))
    (def v (verts.at i))
    (print v.x "\n")
    (set i (+ i 1))
)
```

Table iteration via `keys`:

```bbl
(def player (table "name" "hero" "hp" 100))
(def ks (player.keys))
(def i 0)
(loop (< i (ks.length))
    (def k (ks.at i))
    (print k ": " (player.get k) "\n")
    (set i (+ i 1))
)
```

### vector index access

`at` accesses vector and table elements by index.  Writable via `set`:

```bbl
(def verts (vector vertex (vertex 0 1 0) (vertex 1 0 0)))
(print (verts.at 0).x)                    // read
(set (verts.at 0) (vertex 5 5 5))         // write whole element
```

### member access — the `.` operator

The `.` operator provides field access and method dispatch on typed values.  `v.x` is syntactic sugar for `(. v x)`.

Field read:

```bbl
(def v (vertex 1.0 2.0 3.0))
(print v.x)
```

Field write:

```bbl
(set v.x 5.0)
```

Method call — `.` looks up a function registered on the value's type:

```bbl
(file.write "hello")
```

See [features/method-resolution.md](features/method-resolution.md) for the full resolution algorithm.

### place expressions

`set` accepts **place expressions** — expressions that identify a writable location.

Place writes are **single-level only** — one dot or one `at`, not chained:

| pattern | meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `symbol` | rebind variable: `(set x 5)` |
| `obj.field` | struct field or table string-key: `(set v.x 5)` or `(set player.hp 80)` |
| `(obj.at index)` | container index: `(set (verts.at 0) val)` |

For deeper mutation, use intermediate variables:

```bbl
(def v (verts.at 0))
(set v.x 5.0)
(set (verts.at 0) v)
```

### method dispatch

The `.` operator dispatches methods via **type descriptors**, not vtable pointers.  Every `BblValue` carries a type tag.  The type tag maps to a type descriptor in a global table on the `BblState`.  The descriptor holds the method table.

`(file.write "hello")` → type tag of `file` → type descriptor → method table → `write` → call with `file` as implicit first arg.

See [features/method-resolution.md](features/method-resolution.md) for the full resolution algorithm, per-type rules, and error cases.

Built-in container methods:

| type | methods |
|------|---------|
| `vector` | `push`, `pop`, `clear`, `length`, `at` |
| `table` | `get`, `set`, `delete`, `has`, `keys`, `length`, `push`, `pop`, `at` |
| `string` | `length` (more in string library — deferred) |
| `binary` | `length` |

### import/exec

Exec runs another `.bbl` file.  Two distinct behaviors depending on context:

**From script** — `(exec "file.bbl")`: creates a fresh isolated scope.  The exec'd file cannot see the caller's variables.  Returns the value of the last evaluated expression in the file.

```bbl
(def scene (exec "scene.bbl"))
(print scene.name)
```

**From C++** — `bbl.exec("file.bbl")`: accumulates into the existing root scope.  Each call sees everything previous calls defined.  This is how multi-file workflows share definitions.

**Path resolution**: `exec` paths are resolved relative to the calling script's directory.  C++ `bbl.exec()` resolves relative to the process's CWD (or a configurable base path on `BblState`).

## runtime typing

All values are dynamically typed.  Every value carries a type tag at runtime (tagged union).  There is no compile-time type checking.

Arithmetic operators inspect operand type tags: `int + int = int`, `float + float = float`, `int + float = float`.  Incompatible types (e.g. `int + string`) are a runtime error.

Function arguments are untyped — the caller can pass any type.  The function body discovers types at runtime through the operations it performs.

```bbl
(def double (fn (x) (* x 2)))
(double 5)       // 10 (int)
(double 3.14)    // 6.28 (float)
(double "hi")    // runtime error: * cannot apply to string
```

## ownership model

Simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector.  See [memory-model.md](memory-model.md) for full details.

**One scope type**: a symbol → value table.  Fresh vs shared is the only distinction:
- `fn` call → fresh scope.  Sees: own frame + captured variables from the defining scope.
- `(exec "file.bbl")` from script → fresh root scope.  Isolated.  Returns the last evaluated expression.
- C++ `bbl.exec()` → **accumulates** into the existing root scope.
- `loop` / `if` → shared.  Runs inside the current frame.

**GC**: all heap objects (strings, binaries, closures, containers, userdata) are managed by a mark-and-sweep collector.  Assignment is a pointer copy.  The GC runs periodically.  `~BblState` frees everything.

**Value types** (int, float, bool, null): copied inline.  No GC involvement.
**Structs**: value-type shell.  C++ compatible binary layout.  POD only — `memcpy` on copy.

**Type descriptors**: always global (registered on `BblState`).  Never freed during script execution.

## string interning

All strings are interned in a global table on the `BblState`.  Creating a string hashes it and returns the existing instance if found.  This makes string comparison O(1) (pointer equality) and deduplicates storage.

Interned strings live for the **lifetime of `BblState`**.  They are never evicted from the intern table — `~BblState` frees the entire table.  This avoids coupling the intern table to the GC.  For a serialization DSL that runs and exits, this is negligible.

## command-line usage

Run a script:

```sh
bbl script.bbl
```

Interactive mode (no arguments):

```sh
bbl
```

Interactive mode reads s-expressions and evaluates them immediately.  Multi-line input: the REPL waits for balanced parentheses before evaluating.  An open `(` without a matching `)` continues to the next line.

```
> (print "hello")
hello
> (def greet (fn (name)
.     (print "hi " name)
. ))
> (greet "world")
hi world
```

The prompt switches from `>` to `.` while inside an incomplete expression.

## C++ API

See [features/cpp-api.md](features/cpp-api.md) for the full API specification.

Lua-style embedding.  A `BblState` owns the entire runtime — scope, types, interned strings.

```cpp
BblState bbl;
BBL::addStdLib(bbl);              // register print, file I/O, math
bbl.defn("my-func", my_func);    // register custom C function
bbl.exec("setup.bbl");           // execute script — env persists
bbl.exec("scene.bbl");           // second script sees setup.bbl's definitions

auto* verts = bbl.getVector<vertex>("player-verts");  // introspect env
auto* tex = bbl.getBinary("player-texture");
// ~BblState deallocates all script data
```

Key properties:
- `exec()` does not reset the environment.  Scripts accumulate into the same root scope.
- C functions follow `int fn(BblState* bbl)` — read args by index, push return value, return 0 or 1.
- All errors throw `BBL::Error` (see [features/errors.md](features/errors.md)).
- After `exec()`, C++ can read any variable via typed getters (`getInt`, `getFloat`, `getString`, `getVector<T>`, etc.).

## serialization workflow

The primary use case: dump C++ structs to `.bbl` files, read them back.

```bbl
// scene.bbl — a serialized scene
// vertex and mesh types registered from C++ before exec

(def player-mesh (mesh 1 "hero"))
(def player-verts (vector vertex
    (vertex 0 1 0)
    (vertex 1 0 0)
    (vertex -1 0 0)
))
(def player-texture 0b65536:<65536 bytes of png>)
```
